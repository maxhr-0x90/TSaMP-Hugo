Welp here we are. The true begining of my magnificient quest.

I've still much more to learn on the topic of computational complexity before
trying to defeat the final boss. Nonetheless I think it's important to state some
of my current goals.

First of all, I need to finish Part I of *Computational Complexity: A Modern Approach* by
Sanjeev Arora and Boaz Barak. It shall solidify my understanding of the field and
thus the P vs. NP problem. It will also offer me different point of view on said
problem and thus multiple way to tackle it.

After I've finished that book multiple possibilities are upon me. I will most
likely find another one to read but I think it would be wise to also start reading
the published research papers directly to get a sense of what the standards are in
terms of rigorous proofs and writing in general.

On that note, I will at some point in the future have to look at other attempts
on the problem. That way I'll --hopefully-- avoid making the same mistakes and
learn what paths are the most promising. The [The P-versus-NP page](https://www.win.tue.nl/~gwoegi/P-versus-NP.htm)
should help in this endeavor.

Finally, as a way to increase the goofiness of my quest, my conjecture on the problem
shall be that P = NP. We are on a foolish territory after all, so why not go all the way
:wink:. This, for the time being, will not influence how I work as I'm too much of a
neophyte to really appreciate the intrinsic difference.

Again, I realize the ~~bravery~~ foolishness of my quest. But let's remember that
fun is of the utmost importance. Better not dwell on the details and just press on,
shall we ?

Till we meet again, remember to always be less dense than your notation.  
Goodbye traveler :smile:
