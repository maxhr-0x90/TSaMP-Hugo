Let's waste no time ! We need to find a Millennium Problem.  
But to do so we must understand what each of them are. So here is a quick summary 
of each one. Oh, and I know you have other things to do so there's a TL;DR for each. 
As well as a TS;WM[^1], for the big brains amongst you, in the form of another entry.

Anyway here's the summaries :

[^1]: Too Short; Want More

## Poincaré conjecture

## Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture

## Hodge conjecture

## Navier–Stokes existence and smoothness

## P versus NP

## Riemann hypothesis

## Yang–Mills existence and mass gap


With all of this information I can easily finish step one of my master plan. But 
more on that later.

Till we meet again, remember to always be less dense than your notation.
