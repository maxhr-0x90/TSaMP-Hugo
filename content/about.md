You seem quite lost... It's as if you don't know your purpose here :thinking:  
Maybe I can help. Let's start with the obvious.

## What is TSaMP ?

I think the title is self-explanatory. But I can go into the details if you wish.
TSaMP is a log journal of my journey on my way to becoming a millionaire.
To do so I've decided to solve a Millennium Problem. Easy stuff, easy money.  
Thus this weblog shall be a testament to my genious...

... Or most likely my foolishness.  
In all seriousness this journal is the result of my over-inflated ego. The ego of
a man who, despite lacking the qualifications and experience, thinks he can
solve a Millennium Problem. And whilst being self-aware enough to know this fact
still wants to go through with this idea because "you never know until you try".
Hopefully, I might --at least-- learn a thing or two along the way. And, who knows,
maybe discover new stuff. Nonetheless, don't get your hopes up :upside_down:

## And who are you ?

My name is Donald E. Quixote (not really). I'm an undergrad student in the field
of Computer Science[^1] with a deficiency in common sense.

> "He liked doing stupidshenanigans and not going through with it"

will be my epitaph.  
So if this site seems dead you know why. That being said I don't know how long each entry will take.
So if you want to have more regular updates on my status and see me sink into madness:
come to my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/deq_not_qed) and enjoy my contribution
to the constant logorrhea.

NB: If you ever want an advice for me: **DON'T**. It's not that I don't want to.
I will give you advices, BUT do you really want to base your guidance in life on
a guy who thinks solving one of the most sought-after problem, in a field he
doesn't even understand, will end up in him becoming a millionaire[^2] ?

[^1]: Why are you laughing ?
[^2]: A quixote, for short

## Good luck

People may fear what they don't understand because they know fear. But a fool knows
nothing and thus can't fear. To them climbing a hill or Mt. Everest are the same.
And when it comes to being dense this is the right place, the territory where
foolishness knows no bounds.  
Welcome to TSaMP :sunglasses:
